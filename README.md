## 📖 Literary Charms

Literary Charms is a responsive web project that simulates a book subscription club website. It was developed to apply core Web Responsiveness concepts using HTML and CSS, while also implementing advanced CSS Animation techniques.

Key Features
--> Responsive Design: A fully adaptable layout that ensures a seamless experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

--> Pure CSS Animations: Engaging visual elements and transitions built entirely with CSS to enhance user interaction.

--> Modern UI: A clean and inviting interface designed specifically for book lovers and subscription services.

## 👩‍💻 What I Learned
During the development of Literary Charms, I focused on mastering the visual and structural aspects of web development. My key takeaways include:

--> Responsive Architecture: I learned how to build a fluid layout from the ground up, using Media Queries, Flexbox, and CSS Grid to ensure the subscription club looks great on any screen size.

--> CSS Animation Mastery: I practiced creating smooth transitions and keyframe animations to make the interface feel alive and interactive, without relying on JavaScript libraries.

--> Visual Hierarchy & UI: I applied design principles to organize book collections and subscription plans, focusing on typography and spacing to improve readability.

--> Pseudo-elements & Selectors: I deepened my knowledge of using :hover, ::before, and ::after to create sophisticated decorative elements and interactive buttons.

--> Mobile-First Workflow: I adopted a mobile-first approach, ensuring the most essential features were optimized for smaller screens before scaling up to desktop.
